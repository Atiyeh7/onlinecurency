                    <p>Over many months, after finding this canvas in the basement of a new home, I invited visitors to add something to it. Most contributions were made by friends, with a few by family. Over time, the canvas became filled and chaotic. The reflection of so many distinct personalities. 
I then covered the work in a layer of off-white house paint and used sand paper to remove that new layer, discretely revealing the layers of color beneath. Through this process, the underlying structure of the painting also emerged, the frame and infrastructure that supports what is visible.
Hanging in my bedroom, this work is intended primarily for me. It serves as a reminder that I am one who is many. Formed through the accumulation of others, held together by a shared framework. Seeing it brings me peace, it brings me comfort.
